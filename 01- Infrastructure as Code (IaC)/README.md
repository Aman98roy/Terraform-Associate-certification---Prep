What is Infrastructure as Code (IaC)? 🚀
----------------------------------------

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is essentially a hub that can be used for collaboration across the IT organization to improve infrastructure deployments, increase our ability to scale quickly, and enhance the application development process. IaC allows us to do all this consistently and proficiently. By using IaC for both our on-premises infrastructure and the public cloud, our organization can provide dynamic infrastructure to both our internal team members and ensure our customers have an excellent experience.

Benefits of IaC 🌟
------------------

While there are many benefits of Infrastructure as Code, a few key benefits include:

-   **Simplifying Cloud Adoption**: IaC allows us to adopt cloud-based services and offerings quickly, improving our capabilities in no time. 🌥️
-   **Automation**: By removing many of the manual steps required today for infrastructure requests, we can automate approved requests without worrying about tickets sitting in a queue. 🚀
-   **Capacity-on-Demand**: IaC provides a library of services for our developers, offering capacity-on-demand. Developers and application owners can request and provision infrastructure that better matches their requirements. 📦
-   **Standardization and Consistency**: IaC drives standardization and consistency throughout the organization, increasing efficiency and reducing errors or deviations from established norms. 🔧

Real World Example 🌍
---------------------

Imagine you're a developer at a tech company working on a new web application. In the past, you'd need to submit a ticket to the IT team to provision servers, databases, and networking resources. This process could take days or even weeks! 😰

With IaC, you can write a configuration file that describes the infrastructure you need. For instance, using Terraform, you might write:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  tags = {
    Name = "WebServer"
  }
}

```

Run a single command, and boom! 💥 Your infrastructure is provisioned in minutes, not days. You can even version control these configuration files just like code, making it easy to track changes and collaborate with teammates.
